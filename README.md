Julia bindings using libgobject-introspection.

This was forked from https://github.com/bfredl/GI.jl

This is a work in progress -- I am learning as I go. Focus is outputting code
that can simplify the creation of Julia packages based on GObject libraries, not
dynamic generation of code using introspection.
